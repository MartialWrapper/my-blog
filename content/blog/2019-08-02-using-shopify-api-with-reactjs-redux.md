  In this project, we will use ReactJS with Redux included for developing a
  simple but minimalistic chat application with Socket.IO.

This project is going to feature some really cool technologies such as: ReactJS, with some additions like styled-components for a well-organized app styling.

P.S: I'll try to make a quick but well done prototype as soon as I get some clear ideas about the project's structure. From now, I may leave this entry's status as 'WIP'.
