  In this project, we will use ReactJS with Redux included for developing a
  simple but minimalistic chat application with Socket.IO.

This project is going to feature some really cool technologies such as: ReactJS, with some additions like styled-components for a well-organized app styling.



P.S: This side project is being made by my own. I'll update this post after I start messing (in a playful way, for sure) with Socket.IO's API.
